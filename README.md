7 days with vainla js + html + css. And I feel like I'm lacking some knowledge. To continue this project I will need more knowledge about frameworks and backend.
Swithching to different project to start learning some frameworks (vue probaby) on framewoks, and backend skills.
Will comeback with more baggage of experience and knowledge.
